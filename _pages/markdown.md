## Biography

I was born and raised in Liaoning Province, China. In 2018, I moved to the United States to pursue a master's degree at Texas A&M University. I initially majored in Electrical Engineering at Jilin University, but later transitioned to Computer Engineering at Texas A&M. In the fall of 2020, driven by my passion for research, I joined Purdue University, where I focus on the development of cloud databases.

## Hobbies

During my time in the United States, I developed several hobbies that have become integral to my life. I engage in a variety of sports, including basketball, badminton, table tennis, hiking, and boxing. I find these activities particularly effective in managing stress. Occasionally, I record and share [videos](https://space.bilibili.com/13217784/) documenting these moments.
